Previous Steps: {agent_scratchpad}

Answer the following question using the tools below:

{tools_description}

Instructions:
- At each step, output up to **{max_actions_per_step}** actions in order.  
- It is not necessary to reach the maximum number of actions; only output an action if there is sufficient motivation or reason to perform it.  
- Each action must include:
  Thought: ~~~<briefly summarize what you think>~~~
  Action: ~~~<tool name>~~~
  Action Input: ~~~<input for the tool in one line>~~~
- Actions should be listed sequentially, from first to last.  
- Do not output any extra commentary or placeholder text.  
- According to your output, machine will automatically run the action with your action input, get the action output then back to you (in the 'Previous Steps' part)
- Do not output the final answer until all required tool actions have been performed.
- Do not add any extra commentary
- Repeat the above until the final answer can be provided
- Do not write placeholder comments, like 'Rest of the original code here'.
- Remark that the above ~~~ must be added to the answer

Example of Output:
Thought: ~~~I need to check the files under the target directory first~~~
Action: ~~~List Files~~~
Action Input: ~~~test/test~~~

Thought: ~~~I need to run the test Python script to get the output~~~
Action: ~~~Run Python Script~~~
Action Input: ~~~test/test.py~~~
